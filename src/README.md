# cz-conventional-changelog-jira-first
This is a typeScript implementation of a commitizen adapter for conventional changelogs, with the jira id as first item in the header. It also autodetects the JIRA id from the branch name.

## State of the Project
The Project just started so this is not a working version. Though I decided to publish it and make it open source. I welcome any contribution or improvement.
